BAB dialog before setopts

UL must be doubled to register

player turn:
ignore 1st redzone

6 frames between wait -> facing

so far nothing is done during the dreadful "AI contemplation of doom" phase

enemy attack sequence:
first look for big redzone, then from small redzone,
+  3 green tiles will appear
+~20 target (depends on camera movement, creates redzone, +12)
+ 12 damage calc

enemy miss manip:
~40 frames after damage calc
~5-20 frames before target stops flashing
~right before attack animation begins
successful miss will create redzone

1st U -> 1st allowed A
86 ULULA
90 UU UUA
diags always preferred

ABA is better than just A for those tooltip things

Cyril left -> 47111 - 47152
Cyril down -> 47111 - 47146

LR no need duplicate in equip?

world map input can be started ~3 frames before cursor reappears, at least for A

BAB before setopts

dpad must be doubled to register

player turn:
ignore 1st redzone

6 frames between wait -> facing

so far nothing is done during the dreadful "AI contemplation of doom" phase

enemy attack sequence:
first look for big redzone, then from small redzone,
+  3 green tiles will appear
+~20 target (depends on camera movement, creates redzone, +12)
+ 12 damage calc

enemy miss manip:
~40 frames after damage calc
~5-20 frames before target stops flashing
~right before attack animation begins
successful miss will create redzone

1st U -> 1st allowed A
86 ULULA
90 UU UUA
diags always preferred

ABA is better than just A for those tooltip things

Cyril left -> 47111 - 47152
Cyril down -> 47111 - 47146

LR no need duplicate in equip?

world map input can be started ~3 frames before cursor reappears, at least for A

1st shop (Sprohm)
sell: all armor except Cuirass, all Shields, Bandage, Phoenix Down
buy: 3 Shortswords, 3 Gauntlets
i don't sell unnecessarily because the shopkeeper's questions take very long
in particular i didn't sell cuirass. moving right from armor to accessories tab while equipping costs 3+3+6 extra frames (Bangaa affected twice), but the shopkeeper dialog is far longer than 12 frames. nonetheless further optimisation may be possible.

judge corpse shift should be avoided if possible

dueling WAR + human SLD

WHT must be OHKO'd

47109 Sprohm
62486 Lutia
86299 Nubs

intro, snowball, bangaa: followed FellVisage's run more or less

unequipped armor
changed monk -> warrior
fired viera, nu mou

1st shop (Sprohm, since cursor already on it)
sold: all armor except Cuirass, all Shields, Bandage, Phoenix Down
buy: 3 Shortswords, 3 Gauntlets
i sell largest valued items (450 to 300) to minimise dialog with shopkeeper
notably i didn't sell cuirass. moving right from armor to accessories tab while equipping costs 3+3+6 extra frames (Bangaa affected twice), but the shopkeeper dialog is far longer than 12 frames. further optimisation may be possible.

equipped Shortsword + Gauntlets
paid for herb picking
140 Gil left

not sure what's the best way to move cursor

currently testing enemy stats generated on different frames
stat manipulation is too tedious for me right now

1. HERB PICKING

placed units in normal order
bangaa1 OHKO'd fairy (cost 4 frames)
bangaa1 can crit redcap, but would cost 70 frames! (56935)
mont doesn't do anything useful
human1 crit only took about 20 frames, fortunately
marche crit only took 2 frames lmao

test from 58511; marche KO'd 2nd last enemy -> final input of battle; should marche move? YES
(i think goblin will always head for human1)
don't move, kill next turn - 60335
move 1 tile (don't block human1), let human1 kill - 60219

was a rather easy fight - i doubt bringing 1-2 more units would speed it up
got corpse shifted tho >:(

place lutia, 62597 frames -> 62451 after moving marche

need 2 atmos blades on dueling sub AND thesis hunt - this might be hard; if i can't do it within 60 frames i'll settle for 1
i settled for 1; atmos on dueling wouldn't appear even after 60+ frames [area for improvement, tho idk how much better 1 more atmos'd be]

warrior

64652 - 105/125 - NIN
64677 - 109/129 - NIN
64680 - 104/136 - NIN !!! <- even better, still earlier overall

human (3rd attempt; forgot to buy quest before going to lutia)
132 Speed on 1st frame lmao

changed NIN->SLD, equipped Shortswords

2. THESIS HUNT

law is currently recommend fire; will probably use it instead of Thunder for JP since the frame cost is low

position:
SLD2 WAR2 SLD1 WAR1 MON MAR

WHT, ARC - easy OHKO (turn 1-2)
THF - 2HKO (
SLD - 3HKO

>SLD2 wait? advancing will attract THFA - not good; bait ARC by moving left?
THFA will always reach someone and fight, usually MON or unit to MON's left
THFB will advance
>WAR1 fight THFA, try to do 24-25
WHT will try to heal THFA, else wait, bait him to come down
ARC must fight, DON'T LET HIM ASCEND
>SLD1 advance and turn back to SLDA; let Mont KO THFA?
>MAR must CKO [WHT]
SLDA will fight SLD1
>MON KO [THFA] (try to hit SLD also)
>WAR2 crit SLDA ~24
SLDB will descend and fight

>SLD2 crit SLDA ~24
>WAR1 crit SLDB ~24
>SLD1 
>MAR CKO [ARC]

actual
>SLD2 move DL, wait, +2 frames to make THFA move to WAR1
THFA miss WAR1 (didn't need manip)
THFB will advance D (69800), R (69811)
>WAR1 fight THFA, crit, move DL to move closer to SLD
WHT almost always moves to THFB, but does nothing
ARC advance, miss SLD1
>SLD1 advance, let someone else kill THFA
>MAR crit SLDB, turn back/side makes him move AFTER fight, letting him hit makes him run away
SLDB almost always fight WAR1, didn't need manip
>MON KO [THFA]
>WAR2 crit SLDA 26
SLDB miss MAR, move behind MAR

>SLD2 cannot OHKO ARC, 
THFA miss SLD2 (didn't need manip)
WHT didn't do anything, miraculously
>WAR1 can't OHKO WHT, so KO [ARC]
>SLD1 takes 73 (!) frames to CKO WHT so i decided against it, 1 hit + mont later will kill anyway
>MON KO [WHT] + damage THFB
>WAR2 can't fight SLDA, else first aid, so crit THFB
>MAR CKO [SLDB]
SLDA miss SLD
>WAR1 fight SLD
THFB miss SLD
>WAR2 KO [THFB]
>SLD2 KO [SLDA]

satisfactory; just over 2 turns

human1 and bangaa1 mastered first aid; forgot to consider dispatch AP
1 atmos is quite fast this time (4 frames), but i'm going to need 2 - doesn't help that i need to sit through the stupid dialog before i can check

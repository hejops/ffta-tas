intro, snowball, bangaa: followed FellVisage's run more or less

unequipped armor
changed monk -> warrior
fired viera, nu mou

1st shop (Sprohm, since cursor already on it)
sold: all armor except Cuirass, all Shields, Bandage, Phoenix Down
buy: 3 Shortswords, 3 Gauntlets
i sell largest valued items (450 to 300) to minimise dialog with shopkeeper
notably i didn't sell cuirass. moving right from armor to accessories tab while equipping costs 3+3+6 extra frames (Bangaa affected twice), but the shopkeeper dialog is far longer than 12 frames. further optimisation may be possible.

equipped Shortsword + Gauntlets
paid for herb picking
140 Gil left

not sure what's the best way to move cursor

currently testing enemy stats generated on different frames

stat manipulation is too tedious for me right now

-----

judge corpse shift should be avoided if possible

dueling WAR + human SLD

WHT must be OHKO'd
